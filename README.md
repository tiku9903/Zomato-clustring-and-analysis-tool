This project involves the use of clustering algorithms and sentiment analysis to group restaurants by cuisine types and recommend top restaurants based on customer satisfaction. Here's a breakdown of the key components and the steps involved:

1. Clustering Algorithms for Grouping Restaurants:
You utilized three different clustering algorithms—K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)—to group restaurants based on cuisine types across cities. Each algorithm works differently:

K-Means Clustering: This algorithm partitions restaurants into clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster. It assumes that the number of clusters (K) is pre-defined, and the centroids (mean points of clusters) are recalculated iteratively until stable clusters are formed. You likely used restaurant features such as cuisine type, price range, and ratings as input data.

Hierarchical Clustering: This algorithm builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) where each restaurant starts as its own cluster, and similar clusters are merged at each step. This continues until all restaurants are in one large cluster or until a desired number of clusters is reached. This is useful when the number of clusters is not predefined.

Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM): GMM assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. It is a probabilistic model that assigns a probability for each restaurant belonging to a particular cluster. This method is more flexible than K-Means, as it can accommodate complex cluster shapes.

The purpose of using these clustering algorithms was to identify patterns in restaurant data across different cities, allowing you to group restaurants by cuisine type effectively.

2. City-Specific Tool for Clustering Results:
You developed a city-specific tool that showcases the clustering results. This tool likely allows users to:

Explore restaurant clusters in their city of interest.
Visualize how restaurants are grouped based on cuisine types.
Interact with data to see cuisine preferences in a particular city.
This could be a web-based or desktop application where users can select their city and view the clusters, providing insights into popular cuisines, the distribution of restaurant types, and more.

3. Scraping Zomato Data for Bangalore:
For the city of Bangalore, you scraped restaurant data from Zomato. This involved:

Extracting restaurant details such as cuisine type, location, price range, reviews, ratings, and more.
Data was likely gathered using web scraping techniques, possibly leveraging tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Zomato’s API (if available).
4. Sentiment Analysis on Reviews:
You performed sentiment analysis on customer reviews to assess satisfaction. This likely involved:

Preprocessing the review data (removing stop words, punctuation, etc.).
Using NLP techniques (Natural Language Processing) to analyze the text and classify the sentiment of reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
Tools such as VADER, TextBlob, or machine learning models (like Naive Bayes or BERT) could have been used to analyze the sentiment.
The results of the sentiment analysis provide insights into customer satisfaction for different restaurants.

5. Combining Clustering and Sentiment Insights:
You combined the clustering results and sentiment analysis to recommend top restaurants. Here's how:

Restaurants grouped into clusters based on cuisine types were further refined by analyzing customer sentiment.
Restaurants with positive reviews and high customer satisfaction were identified as top recommendations.
This dual approach allowed you to recommend not only the best cuisine types but also restaurants with high customer satisfaction.
6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Visualization:
To visualize the clustering results, you used Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps in projecting high-dimensional data into 2D or 3D space, making it easier to visualize. Here's how PCA helped:

Reduced the complexity of the restaurant data by compressing features (such as cuisine type, ratings, and price range) into principal components.
Created visualizations (scatter plots, for example) that displayed how restaurants are grouped based on their cluster assignment.
PCA likely highlighted cuisine trends and made it easier to see the similarities and differences between different clusters of restaurants.
Overall Outcome:
The project combined clustering techniques with sentiment analysis to:

Group restaurants by cuisine types across cities.
Recommend top restaurants in Bangalore based on both clustering and sentiment analysis.
Provide users with an interactive tool to explore city-specific cuisine trends and restaurant groupings.
Enhanced the insights through PCA, providing clear and intuitive visualizations of how different cuisine types are clustered and performing.
This approach not only offers an in-depth analysis of restaurant groupings by cuisine but also considers customer satisfaction for better restaurant recommendations.
